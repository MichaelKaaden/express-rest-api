# Express REST API Seed

This little project can be used as seed for any REST API
being served using Node.js and Express.js.

## API Documentation

This seed uses Swagger-UI for documentation purposes. As
[this stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31300756/can-swagger-autogenerate-its-yaml-based-on-existing-express-routes)
suggests, you need to create the swagger.json for yourself.
Else you'd need to use the swagger utilities inside your Express
application instead of using vanilla Express.
