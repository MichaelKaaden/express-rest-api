# Express REST API Seed

This little project can be used as seed for any REST API
written using TypeScript, Node.js and Express.js.

Run the app in dev mode using `npm run dev`. To compile
the sources on change, use `npm run watch`.

## API Documentation

This seed uses Swagger-UI for documentation purposes. As
[this stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31300756/can-swagger-autogenerate-its-yaml-based-on-existing-express-routes)
suggests, you need to create the swagger.json manually.
